Look into problems with coincidenc time during Fall 2018
SHMS reftime is T2 in the trigger tdc module
Should be the same as in hodoscope tdc modules
use kaonlt branch

hpdiff_pre40_reftime histogram of 
shms_pre40_diff=.09776*(pT2_tdcTimeRaw-pPRE40_ROC2_tdcTimeRaw)+pPre40_roc2_offset;
h_diff_pre40_cointime histogram of shms_pre40_diff to epi Cointime
h_diff_trig4_hstof hostogram of 
hstofdiff = .09776*(pTRIG4_ROC2_tdcTimeRaw-hSTOF_ROC2_tdcTimeRaw)+stof_roc2_offset
pTRIG4 is the HMS 3/4 trig 
hSTOF is the HMS STOF
h_hstofdiff_cointime
is 2d plot of hstofdiff versus epi cointime + shms_pre40_diff

RUn 5305
pPre40_roc2_offset = 120
Shows jitter in T2 reftime
h_diff_pre40_cointime shows correlation
Looking at hodoscope scintillators STOF is the reference time
hstofdiff is wide
h_hstofdiff_cointime shows a correlation

RUn 6200
Still shows jitter. Due to using trailing edge of signal
h_diff_pre40_cointime shows correlation
Looking at hodoscope scintillators STOF is the reference time
hstofdiff is wide
h_hstofdiff_cointime shows a correlation


Run 6639
Jitter is totally gone.
h_diff_pre40_cointime has no correlation
hstofdiff is still wide
h_hstofdiff_cointime shows no correlation




Use run 5305
5304-5310
gpbeam = 10.585
gtargmass_amu = 1.00794
htheta_lab = -14.91
ptheta_lab = 9.425
hpcentral = 4.204
ppcentral = 6.053
ppartmass = 0.493677
hpartmass = 0.0005109





****************
Nov 13 2018 fix problem with jitter from using gate generator for delay.
   replaced by cable delay. Good for coincidence runs after 6152

Use run 6200





******************
Nov 27 changed the polarity of the reference time going into the injection
 board for ROCs 1,2 and 3. Good for coincidence runs after 6576

Use run 6635 elastic
run 6639  kaonlt

6635
hpdiff_pre40_reftime one peak sigma = 0.07 ns ( 0.1 bin width)
